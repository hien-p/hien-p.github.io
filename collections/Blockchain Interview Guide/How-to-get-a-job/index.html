They have unlimited potential and everything is possible.</p> <p>The blockchain industry is a relatively broad term. Freshmen can enter this industry from a technical perspective and strive to become developers.</p> <p>Everything has its root and end, every matter has its beginning and end. If you know <strong>what comes first and what comes later, you will be close to the right path.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>First, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>It is necessary to master the basic knowledge and core concepts of blockchain. You should know what blockchain is, how it works, and understand the core characteristics of blocks, chains, hashes, consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS, etc.), distributed ledger technology, Merkle trees, and decentralization and immutability.</p> <blockquote> <p>Then you can learn more about Ethereum* and smart contracts+</p> </blockquote> <p>Gain a general understanding of the Ethereum platform, including its architecture, gas mechanism, account model (EOA and contract account), as well as the definition, working mechanism and application of smart contracts, and a general understanding of how to deploy and execute contracts on the blockchain.</p> <blockquote> <p>A nine-story tower starts with piling up earth; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since we are entering the blockchain technology industry from a technical perspective, learning technology is inevitable.</p> <p>If the questioner does not currently have any computer knowledge, it is recommended that you first learn relevant knowledge, understand programming development languages, and accumulate certain development experience.</p> <p>Assuming that the questioner already has basic computer knowledge and certain development experience, he or she can further learn smart contract development languages and tools. Learning is a process of accumulation over time. Haste makes waste. Only with determination can you persevere to the end.</p> <h2 id=learn-rust>Learn Rust<a class=headerlink href=#learn-rust title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Rust is often used for low-level logic and high-performance computing. Learn basic syntax, including variables, data types, control flow, functions, structures, enumerations, traits, generics, and lifecycles. Also gain an understanding of advanced features like the ownership system, borrow checker, concurrent programming, error handling, and macros.</p> <p>Learn to use Cargo to manage project dependencies, builds, tests, and releases. Gain proficiency in common libraries like tokio, rayon parallel computing, serde, actix-web, anyhow/thiserror, and clap.</p> <p>Practice is a good way to learn a computer language, starting with small projects and gradually increasing the complexity.</p> <blockquote> <p>Blockchain doesn't equal cryptocurrency speculation. 90% of the pitfalls in the industry come from blindly entering the market. The core tasks of a freshman: accumulating knowledge, practicing skills, and networking .</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=learn-solidity>Learn Solidity<a class=headerlink href=#learn-solidity title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The smart contract part usually uses Solidity. Just like learning Rust, you need to master the basic syntax: variables, data types, functions, contracts, events, structures, enumerations, inheritance, interfaces, etc. Then you can further learn about libraries, proxy contracts, upgrade modes, gas optimization, etc.</p> <p>As learning progresses, the ultimate goal should be to start with simple token contracts and gradually write more complex DEX contracts.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: Pay special attention to smart contract vulnerabilities and attack methods to improve contract security. On February 21<sup>st</sup> of this year, Bybit was hacked and nearly $1.5 billion was stolen, which further demonstrates that security is crucial.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=enrich-your-knowledge>Enrich your knowledge<a class=headerlink href=#enrich-your-knowledge title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>You need to understand network security technology, network protocols, network structure, device IP, common encryption technologies, hash functions, asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proof, etc. </p> <p>Centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, wallets, public keys, private keys, addresses, etc. are also required to be learned.</p> <p>If you want to delve deeper into the ever-changing field of blockchain technology, you must continue to enhance your understanding of blockchain technology, not forget your roots, absorb foreign ideas, face the future, and possess the ability to innovate.</p> <p>You must be familiar with the following two documents:</p> <ul> <li>Bitcoin White Paper: It covers the core concepts of blockchain.</li> <li>Ethereum White Paper: Understand the design and goals of Ethereum.</li> </ul> <p>To become a more professional developer, you also need to have a deep understanding of the underlying communication protocols and decentralized protocols of the blockchain, such as <strong>IPFS and Filecoin</strong> or <strong>Walrus</strong></p> <h1 id=practice-experience-the-real-ecosystem>Practice: Experience the real ecosystem<a class=headerlink href=#practice-experience-the-real-ecosystem title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1> <p>Freshman must-do list : 1.
