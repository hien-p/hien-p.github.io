Coding skill means building good products well. You don’t have to code all day to keep or grow these skills—AI can handle the easy parts so you can focus on tough problems.

Tools like Cursor’s Composer can build UIs, but you still need to step in for harder work. You can’t “vibe code” an entire product AI isn’t there yet and still plateaus in some areas.

You’ll always need to fix and manually add things. If you can’t code or debug at all, you’ll get stuck—so those skills are worth learning.

Best thing bạn có thể làm: học càng nhiều dev skills càng tốt, để AI hỗ trợ bạn, nhưng quan trọng là bạn phải thực sự biết cách làm việc với code đó.
