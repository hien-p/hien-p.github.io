You can also use official MCP servers for specific frameworks. Because adding docs directly to Cursor sometimes works inconsistently, so I stopped relying on it.

Another approach is setting **Cursor Rules** to enforce coding style and guidelines. Finally, you can tell the model to do a web search models like Sonnet 4, GPT-4.1, or Gemini 2.5 often do this automatically when they need more info, or you can explicitly write “Research Online”.

Many of us kept forgetting to do certain tasks before leaving the office. So, we created **our own rules and routines** to make sure they’re done every time. That’s essentially how Cursor Rules work.

A rules file in Cursor is like a guidebook for your AI coding assistant. it explains how to write code for your project, what tools are in use, and how everything is structured. This way, the AI can produce code that’s more accurate and better fits your setup.
