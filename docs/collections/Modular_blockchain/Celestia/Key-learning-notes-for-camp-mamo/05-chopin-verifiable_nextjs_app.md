> Chopin Framework lets you build verifiable applications using standard Next.js without changing how you develop. Every user action gets signed and stored as blobs on Celestia, turning regular web apps into applicationspecific rollups. No wallet popups, no extra steps - just familiar Web2 UX with Web3 integrity underneath.

# Core keywords for this lessons: 

- **Chopin Framework:** Turns Next.js apps into verifiable apps on Celestia
- **HTTP request serialization:** All POST requests are ordered, signed, and saved as blobs
- **Embedded wallets (via Para):** Email login auto-creates MPC wallets in the background
- **Sequencer middleware:** Catches requests, keeps them in order, and sends to Celestia
- **Oracle module:** Supplies non-deterministic data (timestamps, random numbers, UUIDs) so replays are consistent
- **EIP-712 structured data:** Ethereum-style signatures for HTTP requests





# Assignment 
Start by adding a location tag (e.g., caf√©, city) for privacy, then get creative add features like ratings, maps, or leaderboards. Chopin handles making your Next.js app verifiable, so focus on building. If stuck, ask in Discord. When done, share publicly on Twitter or Discord to attract early supporters and potential users.
